  <div class="question">What is Clipping?</div>
  <div class="answer">Simply put, You 'Clip' what you 'Like'</div>

<hr style="border-color:#222">

  <div class="question">What happens when I clip?</div>
  <div class="answer">Three small things change in the world:
  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Your clip activity get published in your activity stream. No Posts. Just the stream. We don't like spam either.
  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The product gets on your clip board. Your clip boards are public and you define your online shopping identity by sharing your clip board.
  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) We are working on a 'Clipr Credits' structure. You get rewarded if you add or clip really awesome products.</div>

<hr style="border-color:#222">

  <div class="question">Why would I want to clip?</div>
  <div class="answer">Three simple reasons:
  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Sharing is sexy
  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) You get 'Clipr Credits' which you can redeem to get rewards
  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) You want your friends to know about your collections and your wishlist</div>

<hr style="border-color:#222">
  <div class="question">Clipping is cool. How can I clip products that are not there on Clipr?</div>
  <div class="answer">Add that product. And it will take 5 seconds, we promise. Go to the <a href='add' class='ajax-link'>Add Product </a>page.</div>
