Moghuls brought this art work from Lahore and since then Rajasthan is the main center of Meenakari art work. This adorable meenakari jewellery box is made sensibly and skillfully by the artisans with lots of focus and devotion.<br><br>\r\nTo begin with, the brass sheet is beaten on an iron mould which has designs carved on it. The beating forms small grooves on the designs. Colors in liquid form are then filled into a wooden needle which is used to pour the colors into these grooves gradually and minutely. As each color is separately fired, the base color is filled at the end to avoid darkening and spreading of colors. This firing process helps the color to set and spread evenly. Once coloring is done the golden brass sheet is cut and fixed on a wooden box which is the final procedure of the box making it attractive, stunning and ready to use.<br><br><b>Note: Cash on Delivery is Not Available</b><description2><p class=\"sort_description\"><b>By Artisan House Of Villcart.</b> Try this exclusive jewellery box handmade by the artisans of Udaipur with profusion of  Meenakari Art and colors.<br><b>Note: Cash on Delivery is Not Available</b></p></description2>',NULL,'','http://d1g63s1o9fthro.cloudfront.net/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/images/catalog/product/placeholder/image.jpg$$$http://d1g63s1o9fthro.cloudfront.net/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/r/o/round_meenakari_jewellery_box_-_big.jpg$$$http://d1g63s1o9fthro.cloudfront.net/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/M/M/MMUVILLCA000105_2.jpg$$$http://d1g63s1o9fthro.cloudfront.net/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/M/M/MMUVILLCA000105_3.jpg$$$http://d1g63s1o9fthro.cloudfront.net/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/m/m/mmuvillca_logo_16.jpg','http://www.craftsvilla.com/checkout/cart/add/product/11423/','crafts',NULL,'2012-11-09 16:26:35',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'11423'),(22476,'craftsvilla','http://www.craftsvilla.com/peacock-meenakari-pendant-earring-set.html','Meenakari Pendant Earring Set - Peacock ',500,500,'\r\n        This beautiful meenkari pendant earring set made with copper is a work of art itself, with a beautiful traditional touch.

In the book, Atlas is used as a metaphor for the people who produced the most in society, and therefore \"hold up the world\" in a metaphorical sense. Wise men have said that people who are well read have the power to \"hold up the world\".  These two metaphors were in our mind while we were designing this book shelf.</p>\r\n<p>Trendy, quirky and unique, the Atlas Shrugged can be wall mounted, simplifying space utilization. Atlas Shrugged has been painted with carbon black and bright red making it aesthetically attractive that merge with contemporary homes.\r\n</p><p>The Atlas Shrugged is handmade, and the process is intricate and time-consuming. Starting from scratch to finish, the making of the Atlas Shrugged takes the better part of a month. To ensure that the finished product is well-balanced and blemish free, extreme care is taken during the making of the building blocks (the bamboo strips) and assembling the parts, and particularly during the painting process so that the paint doesn\'t chip anytime in the future.</p>\r\n<p>Stack your books on the Atlas Shrugged and mount it on your living room wall and watch it make for a great conversation starter.
